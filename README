Introduction
This little project is based on the course 6.828(2008) from MIT. The poject initiater tried his best to avoid modifying the original lines or comments as of now and he even adds his new files with a "JOS" thing in the header files just to get a unified look.

Dependence:
gcc, make, binutils (tested on newest version on his box, not sure if it works on very old one)
qemu patched by MIT

*HOWTO*
$make #Compile the source
$sh qemu.sh # Run it
$make clean # Get afresh

**********************
What did this man do?
He implemented all the stubs/files of all the labs left out empty and added a vga driver in order to suppot Chinese GB2312-encoded input/output. Now SMP support has been added.

What is he doing now?
Dunno. Anything that interests him will take the time from him.

What will he might do later?
If he gets more time in hand, possibly he would try to work out a C compiler for this little OS. *Time* is really a headache.

Some more info about the author:
He is of great interest at operating system, networking, compiler technology as much as at girls :P
