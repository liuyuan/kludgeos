Main Players: BSP, AP
	BSP: Bootstrapping Processor
		It is selected by BIOS. BSP manages the initialization of itself and APs
			Job: Its own Registers, such as GDTR, IDR, TR, cr[0-4], Kernal Stacks(its own and for APs), IOAPIC, its own LAPIC, sending SIPI to APS, etc.

	AP: Application Processor
		BIOS designate remaining CPUs as AP.
			Jobs: Its own Registers, LAPIC etc.

	NOTE:AP starts in *Real Mode*

Interrupt related Players: LAPIC, IOAPIC, PIC(8259A)

	 LAPIC: Deliver local/external intrrupts to CPUs.
		a) Manage local interrtups: *LINT[0:1], the APIC timer*, the performance-monitor counters, the thermal sensors, the interal error detector.
		b) Manage Inter-Processor Interrupt.
		NOTE: OS has to conpifgure a timer between PIC and LAPIC. In MP, it is a must to have individual LAPIC timer enabled for MP protocol

	IOAPIC: A relay to external interrupts to LAPIC. It is mainly used to distribute external interrupts to CPUs.

	PIC: Old device to deliver external interrupts to CPU.

	NOTE: Do NOT forget writes to end-of-interrupt(EOI) register to acknowledge interrupt.

Notes on MP:

1 *TLB shootdown*
	In a multiprocessor system, when one processor changes a page table or page directory entry, the changes must also be propagated to all other processors. This process is commonly know as "TLB shootdown".
	means:
		a) memory-based semaphores
		b) interprocessor interrupts (IPI)
	Good refference:"Translation Lookaside Buffer Consistency: A Software Approach." by D.L. Black, R.F. Rashid, D.B. Golub, and C.R. Hill.

2 Local APIC registers address space should be designated as *Strong Uncacheable* for correct operation
